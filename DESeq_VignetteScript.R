# We now have all the ingredients to prepare our data object in a form that is suitable for analysis, namely: 1) countdata: a table with the read counts 2) coldata: a table with metadata on the count tableâ€™s columns. To now construct the data object from the matrix of counts and the metadata table, we use:
ddsFullCountTable <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = countdata, colData = coldata, design = ~ patient + treatment)
ddsFull <- ddsFullCountTable

# Take care of technical replicates (libraries derived from same sample). Here, sample SRS308873 is run twice.
as.data.frame(colData(ddsFull)[ ,c("sample","patient","treatment","time")])

# We recommend to first add together technical replicates (i.e., libraries derived from the same samples), such that we have one column per sample. We have implemented a convenience function for this, which can take am object, either SummarizedExperiment or DESeqDataSet, and a grouping factor, in this case the sample name, and return the object with the counts summed up for each unique sample.
ddsCollapsed <- collapseReplicates(ddsFull, groupby = ddsFull$sample, run = ddsFull$run )

# We can confirm that the counts for the new object are equal to the summed up counts of the columns that had the same value for the grouping factor
original <- rowSums(counts(ddsFull)[, ddsFull$sample == "SRS308873"])
all(original == counts(ddsCollapsed)[, "SRS308873"])
